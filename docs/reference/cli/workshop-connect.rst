workshop connect
----------------

.. @artefact workshop connect

Connect a plug to a slot.

.. rubric:: Usage

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connect <WORKSHOP>/<SDK>:<PLUG> [<WORKSHOP>/<SDK>][:<SLOT>] [flags]

.. rubric:: Description

This command connects a plug to a target slot
that is specified as the second argument or deduced from the context.

- If the second argument is omitted entirely, the target is assumed to be
  <WORKSHOP>/system:<PLUG>; <WORKSHOP> and <PLUG> come from the first argument.

- If the second argument only names the slot itself, the target is
  <WORKSHOP>/system:<SLOT>; <WORKSHOP> comes from the first argument.

- If the second argument omits the <SLOT> name,
  the target slot is the one that uses the same interface as the <PLUG>,
  regardless of the slot's name. However, if there are several slots
  that use the same interface, the command fails.

- If the target slot is compatible with the plug, the command attempts
  to connect them and returns the result.


  Notes:

- To be compatible, the plug and the slot must use the same interface.

- Multiple plugs can be connected to the same slot, but not vice versa.

- The "workshop connections" output will list the connection as "manual".

.. rubric:: Examples

Connect the "mod-cache" mount interface plug of the "go" SDK
under the "nimble" workshop in the current project directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connect nimble/go:mod-cache :mount

A full version of the command that also lists the target SDK ("system"):

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connect nimble/go:mod-cache nimble/system:mount


.. rubric:: Flags

--no-wait

   Return the change ID, don't wait for the operation to finish.
